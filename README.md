Information Retrieval System - Boolean Model
============================================

Repository for the Information Retrieval course's project (A.Y. 2020-2021).

This project implements an IR (Information Retrieval) System able to
answer boolean queries (Boolean model).

The source code for the Java Application can be found in the subfolder [JavaApplication](JavaApplication).

## Project requirements
- Write an IR system able to answer:
- Boolean queries with AND, OR, and NOT.
- Wildcard and phrase queries.
- Some normalisation or stemming can be performed
(for stemming you can use a library)
- You can implement spelling correction.
- Evaluate the system on a set of test queries.

## Presentation
The repository contains a detailed [presentation](Presentation-IRSystem-BooleanModel.pdf) about the system.
